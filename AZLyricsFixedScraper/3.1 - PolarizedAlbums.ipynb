    "3.1 - Polarized Albums\n",
    "---\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to create albums based on songs with the positive or negative polarities. That way, a user can identify which songs bring a more mellow vibe, or a positive vibe. In the case of MF Doom and his complex language, this can be difficult to do typically for those who have not heard his songs or understand his lyrics. The use of nltk's vader is meant to find the polarities of the songs, and present folders containing those of the same polarity. Overall, I think this is pretty cool! If I wanted to find songs of an artist that are more positive and wouldn't put me in a bad mindset, I would use this!\n",
