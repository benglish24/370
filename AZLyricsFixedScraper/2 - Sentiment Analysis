Section 2 focuses primarily on the interpretation of the corpus.
overall, the biggest struggle was dividing the corpus into
different songs to analyze the average polarity of their songs.
The main focus is to see what songs have a negative or positive connotation
and sort them accordingly into playlists.

The goal of this section is to separate the songs based on their scores so 
that further development of this project can lead to anyone
scraping AZLyrics, parse through a list of songs, find the polarity
of the sentences(positive or negative), and returns two playlists
containing the positive and negative songs
