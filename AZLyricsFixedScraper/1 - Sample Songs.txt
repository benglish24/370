[Dr. Doom:]
My servants began to forge what was to become
The most dreaded costume on the face of the earth
The last thing to fit was the mask
Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort

[MF Doom:]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Kurious:]
Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit
(RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C
(Eternally for M-I-C)
Only we save we

[MF Doom:]
By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man


Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the villain surrounded then (AHEM!)

Good to the last drop nigglets
Hood til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses, d*cks are higher
Beat walkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth play, alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosey federallies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell, get lighted on sight
The ring is on a need to know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you on your own, act it alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided fo' while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes an' pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers an' fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves an' strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send 'em a message, let them P.O.W.'s go

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty

A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double expresso, d.a. latte
No smell, nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor, paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stressins
A long list of CEO's names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
And sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system's scared and doubtin' a fair stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught 'im
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when terminator killed tookey

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the villain surrounded, son, then shitâ€¦

Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud
Red flood
VILLIAN!


Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: "Aw, yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye, captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh, Lord"s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

When he at the mic, you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex


Even then I had the uneasy feeling it wasn't young Viktor Vaughn who would need my protection

Motherfuckers, that's why I ain't playin with their ass, that's what's gon' happen to them niggas...
Motherfuckers done fucked up, man. Ain't it some shit like that?

Yo
I'm only rhyming where the drums is at
Y'all niggas think y'all slick with that bullshit bump that
Y'all pay V for flowing to the beat
Not for what he know that got hoes hoeing in the streets
That's for him to know
And for they to never find out
About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse
The coroner report say he simply signed out
OH and I know
Y'all wanna see a wino? Bring the wine out
Cat with a dead mouse is how he catch a phrase, and pause, plays with it
Kill it
And eat off it for days, get it!
Who ever ain't get it ain't supposed to
For standing still close to
Bandits will ghost you
No shoot, Sherlock
I don't know how they do on your block
Out here we rock on to the sure shot
Shit still ain't stop, keep it on 'til your peeps is gone
V be on the creep, no matter what you keep it on
CD debahh.... oh...

Aw-... Ya'll motherfuckers... PLAYIN.... motherfu-

V
Catch the beat too ridiculously
People think he study levitation's true mystery
Had a pal named Ed Leedskalnin until he got him for his sweet 16
He said Ed be Wilin'
Rumor has it things got violent
He clobbered him and broke the fuck out
But he ain't try to rob him
I told her don't tell your man. That's the trouble with these chicks
Next experiment:
Twelve strands from double helix
No I haven't seen Kes, Neelix
"Oh yeah?
Why don't you stay away from her with those lyrics"
Please
Ain't nobody fucking after her
I'm out of here as soon as I fix the flux capacitor
And OH, and speak to V in a proper manner
Before he stabs you and put out all types of propaganda
Stop the slander
Chop the hand of a thief
And cut the mouth off of who ever come out they teeth

V sell time to an inmate
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate
They know who's the renown beat critic
And do a street lyric like, "That's a neat trick!"
Off on a tangent
They ain't got a cent
Supposed to went to management, and spent it getting bent
Sparky, I had enough of your malarkey
For one, don't mark me and who you calling Darkie?
I had to take the nigga car key!


So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off!
The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles
Now they really got troubles
Madman never go (pop!)
Like snot bubbles
